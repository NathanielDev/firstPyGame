precision mode: bullet gets faster after it crosses the border to the other side.

last shot: after being defeated, a player can perform a powerful last shot to attempt to draw the ga\me.

POWERUPS:
SHOT+: upgrades shot
BURST: Shoots a rapid fire 3 round burst (maybe also slows down player speed while shooting)
REFLECT+:Reflect stays for a while longer, and the reflected shot gets upgraded or is faster
INSTASHOT: slows player speed and counts down from 3, then fires a instant laser
SPEED+
TODO:
Maybe make a "PlayerTicket" class to pack all things from the player variable that need to be transitted, and then reassemble that on the client
